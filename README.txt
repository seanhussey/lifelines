`What is survival analysis and why should I learn
it? <http://lifelines.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Survival%20Analysis%20intro.html>`__
Survival analysis was originally developed and applied heavily by the
actuarial and medical community. Its purpose was to answer *why do
events occur now versus later* under uncertainty (where *events* might
refer to deaths, disease remission, etc.). This is great for researchers
who are interested in measuring lifetimes: they can answer questions
like *what factors might influence deaths?*

But outside of medicine and actuarial science, there are many other
interesting and exciting applications of this lesser-known technique,
for example: - SaaS providers are interested in measuring customer
lifetimes, or time to first behaviours. - sociologists are interested in
measure political parties lifetimes, or relationships, or marriages -
Businesses are interested in what variables affect lifetime value

*lifelines* is a pure Python implementation of the best parts of
survival analysis. We'd love to hear if you are using *lifelines*,
please ping me at [@cmrn\_dp](https://twitter.com/Cmrn\_DP) and let me
know your thoughts on the library.

Installation:
-------------

Dependencies:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The usual Python data stack: Numpy, Scipy, Pandas (a modern version
please), Matplotlib

Installing
^^^^^^^^^^

You can install *lifelines* using

::

       pip install lifelines

Or getting the bleeding edge version with:

::

       pip install git+https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines.git

or upgrade with

::

       pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines.git

from the command line.

Intro to *lifelines* and survival analysis
------------------------------------------

Situation: 500 random individuals are born at time 0, currently it is
time 12, so we have possibly not observed all death events yet.

::

    # Create lifetimes, but censor all lifetimes after time 12
    censor_after = 12
    actual_lifetimes = np.random.exponential(10, size=500)
    observed_lifetimes = np.minimum( actual_lifetimes, censor_after*np.ones(500) )
    C = (actual_lifetimes < censor_after) #boolean array

Non-parametrically fit the *survival curve*:

::

    from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter

    kmf = KaplanMeierFitter()
    kmf.fit(observed_lifetimes, event_observed=C) 

    # fitter methods have an internal plotting method.
    # plot the curve with the confidence intervals
    kmf.plot()

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/Bq73IfNl.png
   :alt: kmf


It looks like 50% of all individuals are dead before time 7.

::

    print kmf.survival_function_.head()

    time            KM-estimate
    0.000000        1.000
    0.038912        0.998
    0.120667        0.996
    0.125719        0.994
    0.133778        0.992

Non-parametrically fit the *cumulative hazard curve*:

::

    from lifelines import NelsonAalenFitter

    naf = NelsonAalenFitter()
    naf.fit(observed_lifetimes, event_observed=C) 

    #plot the curve with the confidence intervals
    naf.plot()

.. figure:: http://i.imgur.com/2L7arWXl.png
   :alt: naf

::

    print naf.cumulative_hazard_.head()

    time       NA-estimate
    0.000000     0.000000
    0.038912     0.002000
    0.120667     0.004004
    0.125719     0.006012
    0.133778     0.008024

Compare two populations using the logrank test:

::

    from lifelines.statistics import logrank_test
    other_lifetimes = np.random.exponential(3, size=500)

    summary, p_value, results = logrank_test(observed_lifetimes, other_lifetimes, alpha=0.95)
    print summary


    Results
       df: 1
       alpha: 0.95
       t 0: -1
       test: logrank
       null distribution: chi squared

       __ p-value ___|__ test statistic __|__ test results __
             0.00000 |              268.465 |     True
